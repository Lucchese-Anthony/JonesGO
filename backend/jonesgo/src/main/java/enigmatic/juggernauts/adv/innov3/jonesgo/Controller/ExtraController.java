Answer in 2 sentences or less.\\nHere is some information about Ted:\\nTed Jones, who joined the firm in 1948, is credited with developing the unique business model in which the company focused on small communities and towns that were overlooked by the large, city-based financial firms. This was much different from his father’s vision of opening offices in large cities such as Boston, Chicago, and New York with twenty or so brokers in each one. In addition, Ted Jones (and his successors) chose a narrower focus for the firm than his father, with an emphasis on building a clientele of serious, long-term individual investors. \\nAlthough raised in St. Louis, Ted came to love farming during the many weekends spent on the family’s farm. As a result, he wanted to study agriculture in college, but World War II interrupted his plans. In 1943, after graduating high school and attending a summer semester at the University of Missouri, he enlisted with the U.S. Merchant Marines just shy of his 18th birthday. In June 1945, he volunteered to serve in the Army and had attained the rank of first sergeant at the time of his honorable discharge in 1946. \\nUpon returning home at age 21, Ted enrolled at the University of Missouri to study agriculture, but after one year, his father took him out of school. The senior Jones wanted his son to pursue a career in the securities industry, not farming. He sent Ted to New York in 1947 to take a\\njob as a page on the floor of the NYSE. During his time in New York, Ted also worked at Josephthal & Co., Edward D. Jones & Co.’s New York correspondent, where he held several low-level positions. \\nTed resided in a boarding house during his time in New York. His stay in the Big Apple confirmed how much he disliked big cities and his suspicion of how many people\\nin the business—stockbrokers, pages, and reporters who covered the markets—appeared to treat investment as a crapshoot. “The thing I got through my head that I’ll never forget,” he later said, “was that they didn’t know any more about which stocks are going up than the man on the moon.” \\nHe stayed in New York for one year. Years later, Ted\\nwould say that his time at the stock exchange taught him\\nthe importance of conservative investing. Ted came back\\nto St. Louis to work for his father’s firm as its eighteenth broker, based in the small suburb of Clayton. It was an event that went largely unnoticed at the time. After all, many sons follow in their father’s footsteps, especially in small-business enterprises. In the long run, however, Ted would become perhaps his father’s most consequential hire. \\nAfter his first month at Edward Jones, Ted noticed that he had been credited for sales that he didn’t make and commissions were posted to his account. Knowing that he hadn’t yet opened any new accounts, he talked to his father about it. \\n“Well, son, I just thought you ought to have a little help,” his father said. \\n“I will not take charity,” Ted replied. “If I am going to work for this company, I’m not going to stay in St. Louis. I am going to move out to the country.” \\nDetermined to be independent, Ted moved to Montgomery City, Missouri, population 5,000. Why Montgomery City? Pat Young, his high school sweetheart, whom he married in 1950, attended the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, where she was an agriculture major. Columbia was only an hour’s ride from Montgomery. His second motive was his love for farming. His plan was to call on farmers and people who lived in\\nrural communities. Ted knew he would enjoy talking to farmers as well as people who lived in small towns. As a former agriculture student who spent most of his summers on his family’s farm, he felt very comfortable talking to farmers. He spoke their language, unlike other salesmen who came from St. Louis to sell them anything from books\\nto sewing machines; they welcomed him as one of their own. It was a great fit. Ted had the best of two worlds; he could build his business and be where he wanted to be. \\nWhat Ted quickly discovered was that while affluent St. Louisans were prospering from the services provided by the horde of brokers selling investments in the city, there were also potential investors living in rural areas who were being disregarded. Ted recognized there was a large untapped market of prospective clients who were scattered across\\nthe countryside, too spread out for other brokers to bother pursuing. This meant that Americans who were not residing in big cities rarely invested in the stock market. It was not as though small-town folk were not good prospective clients; brokers simply did not solicit their business. With his knowledge of farming and likable personality, Ted was well received in these communities. \\nTed recognized the need to focus the firm mainly on providing investment advice to the rural middle class—an underserved market. This clientele consisted of people who had never before worked with a financial advisor. Clients were relatively small investors with specific goals in mind— seeking to cover their children’s education, securing financial independence when they retired, and so on. These were conservative investors who weren’t out to make a killing in the stock market. They wanted a steady return over the years. \\nHis plan was for the firm to grow, one client at a time, by selling securities to individual investors, most of whom in all likelihood had never owned a bond or a share of stock. Jones knew that the bedrock for the growth of his company would be the trusted relationships he built with his clients. Ted recruited and trained other brokers to do what worked for him. He taught them to take the time to get to know their clients, understand them, and find out how they thought. He stressed building a personal relationship with each and every client, and only then could a financial advisor understand a client’s tolerance for risk and his or her financial goals. This philosophy of establishing strong relationships with clients became a core tenet of the firm’s way of doing business and continues to be a cornerstone for every Edward Jones financial advisor to this day. It also supported the firm’s overall sense of purpose—which was to improve the lives of its clients and the communities where they lived. \\nIt took tenacity and conviction to succeed with this approach, and it often involved driving two to three hours daily to sell an intangible product to individuals who knew little about investing in securities. To make a sale, Jones would first educate his prospective clients on what it was that they were buying, and then he had to convince them that a stock certificate—a piece of paper—would increase in value, and that unlike other properties, it was a liquid asset that could be sold at any time. Of course, the first thing he had to do was sell himself. \\nAs a traveling salesman, sometimes Ted would be on the road for three or four nights in a row. He was one of the original so-called “Tuesday through Thursday” brokers, or TNT, a group of young Edward D. Jones & Co. salesmen who traveled their territories during the week before returning to the home office in St. Louis on Friday. There, the TNT brokers would catch up on market news and follow up on the orders they had gathered and placed by telephone over the previous few days. \\nOnce he elected to establish himself in Montgomery City, Ted set up shop on the second floor of the local hardware store and sold securities out of the trunk of his car. Each day, he drove 150 miles, making calls in small towns throughout northeast Missouri. Over the next ten years, Ted succeeded in building a large clientele that consisted mainly of farmers and small-business owners spread out across the countryside of Missouri and even into neighboring Illinois. \\nIn 1957, Ted paid a visit to Frank Kister, a client and friend who was also the founder and president of the Savings & Loan Association in the small town of Mexico, Missouri. Ted explained to him that he had a small problem. The firm had been allocated a large block of common stock in a forthcoming underwriting in Mexico Refractories, a local company. Ted was unsure Edward Jones could handle the allocation and asked Kister if he knew of any local brokers who could help sell the offering. “That’s really all I had in mind,” Ted would recall in telling the story later. “Someone who would help me sell and get around to see everyone who wanted Mexico Refractories stock.” Kister recommended Warren “Zeke” McIntyre, a pillar of the community. Ted and Zeke quickly agreed to terms. \\nMcIntyre stayed on to build a thriving business. When he started, he initially worked out of an office slightly bigger than a clothes closet, located on the floor above Scott Five & Dime Store in Mexico. The rent was $25 a month. The office measured approximately ten feet by twelve feet and had enough room for a desk, two wooden chairs, a coat rack, a lamp, and an old black telephone that McIntyre used to place orders through an operator via long-distance calls to St. Louis. \\nOne year later, Ted met with Kister, the banker who introduced him to McIntyre. “How much did Zeke make with your firm?” Kister asked. \\n“He had a very good year,” Ted answered. When pressed to tell Kister how much, Ted said that Zeke cleared over $24,000 during the past year. \\n“That’s a lot of money,” Kister said. “But much more important, how much did you make?” \\nWhen Ted said $5,000, the banker replied. “You made $5,000 on that office? Ted, you’re in the wrong business. You shouldn’t be in the business of talking to me about stocks and bonds. You should be in the business of opening offices like Zeke’s all over the country.” \\nTed didn’t act immediately. He liked to mull things over before he made important decisions. He had a lot of time to think while he drove the countryside around Missouri and Illinois. Being a cautious man, he sent his auditor to Zeke’s office to make sure the numbers were accurate. He wanted to see if the office was making a profit for the firm, even factoring in its fair share of the central overhead. \\nThe auditor told Ted, “Even after expensing every possible item you can think of, you are still going to make a definite profit.” Ted was convinced and ready to hire his next broker in Jefferson City, Missouri. \\nBased on the success of Zeke McIntyre’s office, Ted realized there was a vast potential market for the Edward Jones model in the towns of rural America. He had a vision for a market that no one else had seen. He knew that the people of rural America needed to plan for their financial futures, just like anyone else. Farmers might not have had electricity or running water, but they had surplus cash, and so did the undertakers, the store owners, the doctors, and the dentists. Ted recognized that these people had financial needs the firm could satisfy. In Mexico, for example, all a resident had to do was pick up the phone and call ol’ Zeke, or even better, just walk into his office. McIntyre was always happy to see them. Many of his business meetings occurred over the coffee counter at nearby Dobyn’s Café, the Rotary Club, or on the golf course. \\nMcIntyre’s office served as a prototype for other branch offices that were later opened by the firm. This called for a change in the firm’s business plan, one that would result in Edward D. Jones & Co. becoming one of the nation’s foremost investment brokerage firms. Ted believed in opening branch offices with one broker per office, each of whom was trained in the same manner as the firm’s TNT brokers. The company set up a training program unlike any other in the industry. It recruited and trained young college graduates, individuals without previous backgrounds in the securities industry. These recruits were taught the fundamentals of the financial markets, and they were trained to learn and develop the people skills and strong sense\\nof purpose that Ted felt were essential for every salesperson to succeed. \\nOne of the early TNT brokers was Jack Phelan, Ted’s cousin, who had his own territory in neighboring Illinois, where he went on to build a substantial clientele in towns like Salem, Olney, Lawrenceville, Mount Vernon, Fairfield, and Nashville. Typically, these towns had populations of 8,000, although some had as many as 25,000 people, and others had fewer. Typically, they would have two funeral homes, one or two grain elevators, two banks, a Sears, Roebuck, and a half-dozen or so filling stations. There would also be one or two hotels, usually situated near the railroad station. At the time, there were no motels, which meant Ted and Jack would stay on the second floor of a local small- town hotel where a room typically cost $2.50 a night. For an extra $1.25, breakfast and dinner were served downstairs. Each bedroom was equipped with an iron bed, a dresser, a washbowl, and mirror, two chairs, and a desk. A communal bathroom was down the hall.\\nEdward Jones trainees were routinely sent to a town where they didn’t know anyone. From the start, registered representatives, as they were known at the time, were encouraged to shake hands with 1,000 prospective clients as soon as possible after they moved to a new location, just as Ted Jones did during his early days at the company. To reach this objective, each trainee typically put in eight to ten months, working ten-hour days, knocking on doors, and encountering considerable amounts of rejection in between the successful visits. \\nTed understood that if a financial advisor could endure this difficult period, he (unlike today, at the time they were all male) had the needed tenacity to enjoy a promising career with the company. To be sure, there were recruits who resisted making cold calls, some even expressing that they thought it was unprofessional. \\n“I didn’t go to college so I could get a job as a door-to- door salesman,” some irately expressed. Ted made it clear that refusing to make cold calls was not an option. He\\nlet them know that every Edward Jones financial advisor begins his career with the firm that way—just as he did. “If it’s beneath your dignity,” he would say, “then go work somewhere else.” \\nIndeed, making 1,000 cold calls was a grueling undertaking. Ted knew firsthand that it wasn’t a task for the faint of heart. He also believed that any financial advisor who could endure month after month of cold calls and countless ten-hour days was certain to be someone with determination. Ted knew that the financial world was filled with times when the market went up and then came crashing down; he wanted to build an organization that had tough people who could survive tough times. This philosophy became deeply ingrained in the company culture. \\nTed had also laid the foundation for the principle by which the firm would be run. As a partnership, the firm was built on the power of individual entrepreneurs in offices with one financial advisor in each location. \\nUsing a sports analogy akin to the home court advantage in basketball, Ted said that in sales, it is more advantageous to meet with customers where they live or work. He told\\nthe financial advisors that by being there, they could pick up clues about a prospective client’s needs that might otherwise not be disclosed in the branch office. For instance, a photograph of grandchildren might trigger a conversation about an investment to fund college educations. Perhaps the client hadn’t thought about it yet or did and had been procrastinating. In another scenario, a financial advisor might discover that he and the client both had a passion for dogs or sailing or fine art. Or a financial advisor might see a framed photo or a trophy that lets him or her know the prospective client was involved in a particular charity drive, such as the American Cancer Society or Special Olympics. Ted stressed how these bits of information help build rapport with clients that lead to long-term relationships. \\nThe firm opened other offices in small towns, and in 1960 established one in Pueblo, Colorado, even though it required the installation of a 1,500-mile telegraph wire to link to St. Louis headquarters. Ted’s brother-in-law, Bill Lloyd, headed the Pueblo branch office. When Ted’s father questioned him about the wisdom of opening a remote office in Colorado, the younger Jones said, “We’re going to string offices all the way back to St. Louis.” His father retorted, “We’ll probably go broke before you get those offices between here and Colorado.” \\nIt took a herculean effort to open offices one by one following the telegraph wire. Ted would spend many days driving along the highway looking for towns that would support an Edward Jones branch office. These were places like Dodge City, Hays, Great Bend, Manhattan, and Goodland in Kansas. In other states, towns such as Ponca City in Oklahoma and Jefferson City in Missouri were a few of the countless communities that represented the firm’s new \\nfrontier. It was a slow but steady process. There were fifty- three Edward Jones branch offices when the Pueblo office opened. By 1967, there were 100 financial advisors in slightly fewer branches. \\nThere were many naysayers who thought the one-broker office approach was doomed to fail. The competing stock brokerage firms were located in large cities, most having\\n(or striving to have) many brokers working in each of their offices. They believed the law of economies of scale dictated this. Having many revenue-producing brokers in an office that would share common expenses would, in theory, substantially reduce the overhead per broker. \\nThe doubting Thomases argued that farmers and small- town folks were not good prospective clients, another reason a stockbroker office in a small town was destined to go belly-up. Ted knew his customers, and he knew Edward Jones could fulfill a need in an untapped marketplace. \\nTed was certain that a one-person office in a small community would have less overhead because everything from the cost of rent to taking a client to lunch would be less. Another advantage of being a one-person office in small communities while other brokerage firms focused on large cities meant that Edward Jones had virtually no competitors with offices where it did business. \\nJim Weddle, who served as Edward Jones’ managing partner from 2005 through 2018, described the formula as quite simple. “Give the right kind of people the chance to build their own businesses, back them up with the kind of support system they won’t get anywhere else, and reward them well for their efforts. That way, you ensure that all of their energy, intelligence, and enthusiasm is focused to the ultimate benefit of the client—and the firm. You are not an abstraction to the client—and the client is not an abstraction to you.” \\nThe company that Ted was building was much different from what his father had in mind. Back in 1922, Edward Jones Sr. planned on building a traditional brokerage firm with branch offices in big cities, each having several brokers, a staff of office workers, and a branch manager to supervise everyone. The father and son were different personalities, and this was immediately apparent by their appearances. Edward Jones Sr. was a highly stylish man. He always dressed in a fine suit and looked like a distinguished executive who should be seated at the head of the table. His son was more laid-back. A humble man, Ted felt at home talking to a farmer in a barn, with his tie loosened and his sports jacket tossed over his shoulder. Ted often carried a bandana and, at times, would pull it slowly out of his pocket and mop his brow with it. Sometimes, he gave the impression that he was a plain-speaking country boy, and whenever he checked into a hotel, he would put “farmer” as his occupation. As it is said, impressions can be deceiving. Ted Jones, like his father, was an astute businessman. \\nAlso like his father, Ted was dynamic, but in a different way. No doubt their dissimilarities made them a better team, because it brought different perspectives to the table that,\\nin turn, spawned different solutions. Had they both thought identically, it would have been unlikely that Edward D. Jones & Co. would have grown to be the firm it is today. \\nWhile having different personalities, father and son shared certain common denominators. They were highly intelligent, hardworking men, and both were dedicated to serving their associates and their clients. They were men of high integrity and treated all people with respect. Above all else, both men were committed to help their people succeed. \\nTed maintained that the firm’s owners should work for the company and even denied his two sisters a share because they did not work there. By being privately owned, the firm’s management can make decisions based on what is best for its clients, rather than having to concern themselves with meeting Wall Street earnings targets or being held account- able to shareholders. To this day, the firm’s parent company, The Jones Financial Companies, L.L.L.P., has remained a limited liability limited partnership, owned only by its associates and retired associates. It is not publicly traded. \\nIn 1968, after twenty years as a financial advisor, Ted, then 42 years of age, succeeded his father and became the firm’s second managing partner. He remained focused on serving investors in small towns and communities that had been overlooked by the major firms. By meeting face-to-face with clients, building strong relationships, and offering conservative, quality investments to be held for the long term, Ted believed his company would find a niche in the marketplace that would differentiate it from the competition. The firm’s focus on serving its customers has been crucial to its long- term success. J.D. Power, the data analytics company, has consistently given Edward Jones the highest score in investor satisfaction with full-service brokerage firms. \\nTo this day, the branch-office structure that Ted pioneered is a defining element of Edward Jones’ organization. The company is known for its entrepreneurial spirit, as each financial advisor runs his or her own branch. The vast majority of branch offices are run by one financial advisor and one branch office administrator (BOA) as a team effort. The BOA plays a vital role in the success of each office. He or she is the first-person clients interact with when they come into the office or call on the phone. And being a salesperson, Ted Jones understood that you only get one chance to make a good first impression. \\nBOAs are deeply involved with clients and are responsible for building loyalty and nurturing relationships with them. They are frequently interacting with clients and focus\\non what is most important to the client, with particular attention to the key moments that matter. BOAs wear many hats—they execute client and branch processes and facilitate branch-business planning. They assist clients through the digital client experience and the appointment process. They also are known for how well they know the firm’s clients, often adding caring touches and checking in with them in a way that makes each client feel special. In short, BOAs are key for making the clients feel understood, secure, informed, \\nand in control, all of which is vital to the client experience. Edward Jones stresses the independence of operating one’s office in its recruiting practices when hiring financial advisors. The firm’s financial advisors and BOAs cite the opportunity to help people achieve better lives tied to purpose as the most fulfilling role that they play. Edward Jones looks for self-motivated entrepreneurs with a desire to run their own businesses; in addition to recruiting financial advisors who have established themselves elsewhere, the firm often recruits mid-career professionals from outside the financial services industry. \\nWhen once asked after his retirement why he never sold out and became as rich as Sam Walton, Ted Jones’ reply spoke volumes. “I am the richest man in America,” he said. “I have a wife who loves me in spite of my faults. I have four dogs. Two love only me. One loves everybody. One loves no one but is still very loyal. I enjoy my business. I love my farm and my home. I have a few close friends, and money has never been my god.” \\nIn the late 1950s, more than a decade before Ted Jones was named managing partner, John W. Bachmann, a young student majoring in economics at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, was looking for a summer job. In the winter of 1959, Jack Phelan suggested to Bachmann’s father that his son, whom Phelan had met a few years earlier when he was a high school student, should come and see him about a summer job with the firm. Bachmann reached out, and as luck would have it, an internship was available. He spent the summer in St. Louis working at the company’s home office— the first of two summers interning at Edward Jones. \\nIn 1960, while earning an MBA from Northwestern University, Bachmann joined the firm and worked in the home office in the investment banking department. Ted hinted to John that he should consider becoming a financial advisor and mentioned an opportunity that existed in Columbia, Missouri. An ambitious young man, John opened a branch office in 1963 in the college town of Columbia. In 1970, at age 32 and only seven years after starting his full-time career with Edward Jones, Bachmann was named a principal in the firm, in charge of fixed-income product marketing. \\nIn the early 1970s, Edward Jones had 100 financial advisors, mostly in the Midwest surrounding St. Louis.\\nIt was a successful regional brokerage firm but unknown nationally. On April 17, 1972, Bachmann drafted a detailed memo titled “The Future of Edward D. Jones & Co.” The memo, which he distributed to the firm’s partners, began by stating what the firm had accomplished during its fifty-year history. Bachmann highlighted that while the company had good people, its small-office approach would be copied by other firms, and Edward Jones would lose its competitive advantage unless specific advancements were made. He stressed that the firm should not abandon what had been successful, but instead fine-tune its business in order to grow at scale. He suggested that rather than modeling their approach after that of other financial-services firms, they should study the success of companies like McDonald’s or Holiday Inn—companies known for replicating a consistent customer experience at hundreds of locations. Bachmann also believed the company’s future depended on quantifying its plans for the future in writing in order to make decision- making easier and more efficient. \\nIn the memo, Bachmann then turned his attention to a series of actionable steps to initiate a significant—and, in his mind, necessary—growth phase for the firm. The first step he listed was by far the boldest: “Have 1,000 offices as a major goal, along with a timetable for reaching it.” \\nIt was a radical notion. At the time, Edward Jones had just 100 branch offices. Bachmann was suggesting growing to ten times that number. Some felt that it was a completely unachievable goal, but Bachmann stood by it, believing that bold goals were necessary to keep the organization focused and motivated. \\nWhile that initial statement garnered the lion’s share of attention, the rest of the memo was equally important. It included a list of steps that would help the firm establish a strong structure and formal plan around its business. \\nPrior to the historic memo, Edward Jones did not have a formal plan. Like most small enterprises, it developed its way of doing business organically, without a formal structure. The firm was successful, and Bachmann recognized that to be a major player in the investment brokerage business, Edward Jones needed defined direction. It took courage and conviction for a young rising executive—he had only been a principal for two years at that point—to send such a memo to the company’s senior leadership. Fortunately, it was well received by Ted, who committed the firm to implementing the plan of action. In a sense, the memo had, for the first time, established the formula for the firm to focus solely on serious, long-term individual investors—the same kind of clients Edward Jones serves to this day. In the years since\\nits writing, the 1972 memo has become part of the Edward Jones history, deeply embedded in its culture. Ted Jones’ response to it clearly acknowledged the firm’s receptiveness to suggestions and ideas from its people. \\nThe memo initiated the firm’s commitment to expand, but Bachmann always gave credit to his partners for its implementation. The expansion was a huge undertaking, and to make it happen, he would emphasize, involved a lot of hard work by many very capable men and women. \\nBy 1978, Edward Jones had more than doubled its number of branch offices to 220, and that number had grown to more than 300 by 1980, when Ted stepped down from leading\\nthe firm on a day-to-day basis and Bachmann was named managing partner. With the firm’s master plan fully in place, the firm had close to 1,000 offices spread across thirty-six states by the mid-1980s. The goal of having 1,000 offices was achieved in 1986 when an Edward Jones branch opened in Stoughton, Wisconsin.\"\n" +
